# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. The goal of this project is to show knowledge of basic React Native features, such as styling, navigation, native mobile features, and managing app state with Redux.

This simple app can store collections of question/answer pairs for quiz purposes. User can add new Decks (collections of questions) and new questions to particular deck. Question is presented and user checks if he knowes the answer comparing it to answer showed. Score is showed when deck of questions is finished.

There are 2 decks of questions delivered with app, feel free to add some more. All data is saved to local storage.
